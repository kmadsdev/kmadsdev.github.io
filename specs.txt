I want to build a portifolio in react
It'll be on github pages at this repo: kmadsdev/kmadsdev.github.io

specs:
```
wh_colo = "#ffffff"
bg_color = "#131313"
2nd_color = "#1e1e1e"
special_color = "#ff014f" # i'll also refer this color as "something.(red)"
linkedin_link = "https://linkedin.kmads.dev/"
github_link = "https://github.kmads.dev/"
email = "kaiquemoreira520@gmail.com"

# Note: don't worry about the images, name whatever you want it and then point it to me after and i'll get the assets
# Note: all the images will be at "/assets"
```

follow the SVG OR the PNG instructions (they are the same, pick the one that you want)
